          <p>Zurich is an upmarket banking city and the financial capital of Switzerland. It, therefore, comes as no
            surprise that it’s often labelled as the most expensive city in the world. Zurich is famous for luxurious
            lifestyles, high-end shopping, and fancy chocolates. However, despite its expense and extravagance, it is also
            ranked as one of the best cities to live in the world.</p>
