        <p>Zurich is an upmarket banking city and the financial capital of Switzerland. It, therefore, comes as no
          surprise that it’s often labelled as the most expensive city in the world. Zurich is famous for luxurious
          lifestyles, high-end shopping, and fancy chocolates. However, despite its expense and extravagance, it is also
          ranked as one of the best cities to live in the world.</p>
